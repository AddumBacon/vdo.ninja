# What is VDO.Ninja?

## What is VDO.Ninja?

In its simplest form, [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja) brings live video from a smartphone, tablet, or remote computer, directly into OBS Studio or other browser-enabled software. VDO.Ninja is offered as a free web service, but it's also available as customizable and deployable code. Some have called it the modern Swiss Army knife of audio and video transmission. ðŸ› \
