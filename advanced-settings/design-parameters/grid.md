Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md))

## Aliases

* `&ruler`
* `&thirds`

Applies an rule-of-thirds grid overlay to the self-preview video window. This is useful for passively nudging guests to better center themselves while on camera.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
As of v23, it now works in non-room mode:\
