# \&grid

Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md))

## Aliases

* `&ruler`
* `&thirds`

## Details

Applies an rule-of-thirds grid overlay to the self-preview video window. This is useful for passively nudging guests to better center themselves while on camera.

{% hint style="warning" %}
As of [v19.0](../../release-notes/v19.md), this only works for guests of a room or of a faux-room. It doesn't yet support basic push/view links, as those don't use the auto-mixer code -- which is where this code is currently applied.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
As of v23, it now works in non-room mode (basic push links):\

You can now also toggle it in the director's room to add it to the guest's link:\
