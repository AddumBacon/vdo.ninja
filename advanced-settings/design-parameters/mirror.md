# \&mirror

General Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md), [`&view`](../view-parameters/view.md), [`&scene`](../view-parameters/scene.md))

## Options

Example: `&mirror=2`

| Value            | Description                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (no value given) | Mirroring is forced for all videos                                                        |
| `0`              | Preview video is mirrored only (excluding rear cameras and OBS Virtualcam/NDI)            |
| `1`              | Mirroring is forced for all videos                                                        |
| `2`              | Inverts the default; local previews are not mirrored, but guests are mirrored             |
| `3`              | Same as default, except everything is mirrored, including text - useful for teleprompters |

## Details

Mirroring does not work if using the browser's native video full-screen button. Use [`&effects=2`](../../source-settings/effects.md) instead for this use case.

Try `F11` or the Electron Capture app (right-click â†’ Resize window -> Fullscreen) to hide the browser menu instead.

#### Alternative method for mirroring and flipping

If you are looking for a form of rotation and flipping that rotates the actual video, rather than relying on CSS to achieve it, you can check out the sender-side [`&effects`](../../source-settings/effects.md) options.\
\
`https://vdo.ninja/beta/?effects=-1`,  which will flip the video `https://vdo.ninja/beta/?effects=-2`,  which will flip and mirror the video\
`https://vdo.ninja/beta/?effects=2`,  which will mirror the video\
\
Effects however may increase CPU/GPU usage, and could cause frame rate instability, especially if the browser tab is not in active focus.
