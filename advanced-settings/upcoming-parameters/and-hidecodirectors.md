# \&hidecodirectors

Director Option! ([`&director`](../../viewers-settings/director.md))\
\* on [https://vdo.ninja/beta/](https://vdo.ninja/beta/) and [https://vdo.ninja/alpha/](https://vdo.ninja/alpha/)

## Details

`&hidecodirectors` will hide the co-directors from appearing in the director's room. You might have a few co-directors join you, but they might be taking up space, so this is a way to prevent that. It simply hides the boxes; they are still there at a code level.
