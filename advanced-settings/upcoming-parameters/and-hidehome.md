# \&hidehome

General Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md), [`&view`](../view-parameters/view.md), [`&scene`](../view-parameters/scene.md), [`&solo`](../mixer-scene-parameters/and-solo.md), [`&director`](../../viewers-settings/director.md))\
\* on [https://vdo.ninja/alpha/](https://vdo.ninja/alpha/)

## Details

`&hidehome` hides the VDO.Ninja homepage and many links that lead to it. You can also enable at a code level with `session.hidehome=true;`, which is useful if doing a self-deployment, where you don't want anyone to stumble onto the site and start using it. You'll still be able to join push links and create rooms via URL parameters, but that's about it.
