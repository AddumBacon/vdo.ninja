# \&mobile

Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md))\
\* on [https://vdo.ninja/alpha/](https://vdo.ninja/alpha/)

## Details

`&mobile` will optimize a guest/push link for a mobile device. It might help reduce CPU issues.

There are [`&flagship`](and-flagship.md) and [`&forceios`](../../source-settings/and-forceios.md) as two options to configure mobile devices, but `&mobile` and [`&notmobile`](and-notmobile.md) are more generic options.

``[`&notmobile`](and-notmobile.md) might be able to improve video quality (in case you want to override the automatic defaults, which already detects if a device is mobile or not).
