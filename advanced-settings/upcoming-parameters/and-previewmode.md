# \&previewmode

Director Option! ([`&director`](../../viewers-settings/director.md))\
\* on [https://vdo.ninja/alpha/](https://vdo.ninja/alpha/)

## Details

There is a new button in the director's room. It lets you toggle between a Preview layout and the normal Director layout; the Preview layout will mirror what a basic [`&scene=0`](../view-parameters/scene.md) link would look like.

Useful if you want to switch to a guest-like mode as a director, and then switch back as needed to the director's room to make adjustments. To enter this mode by default,`&previewmode` can be used by the director.
