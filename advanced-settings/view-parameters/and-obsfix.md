# \&obsfix

Viewer-Side Option! ([`&view`](view.md), [`&scene`](scene.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md))

## Options

Example: `&obsfix=5`

| Value            | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| (integer value)  | adjust the sensitivity of the packet loss 'fix' for OBS |
| (no value given) | defaults to 15                                          |
| `0` \| `off`     | Turns it off                                            |

## Details

It's on by default and set to `15` if only using OBS and if using the VP8/VP9 video [codec](../../advanced-settings.md#codec).

* There is a bug in OBS where the VP8 codec (default in most cases) does not handle packet loss events. This function attempts fixes its.
* You can disable this 'fix' by passing it the value `0` or `off`.
* When on, it will trigger a key frame request to combat pixel smearing caused by packet loss and poor network conditions.
* Triggers around every 3-seconds if needed; may not activate often with very light packet loss.
* May lower video quality, or may not be desirable, so this flag lets you disable it.
* Stream pushers can open the debug/stats menu and manually send key frames also.
* VP9 is far less prone to packet loss issues, but it can still happen with heavy packet loss.
* Increasing the integer value passed to `&obsfix` will reduce the frequency and sensitivity of the key frame request.
