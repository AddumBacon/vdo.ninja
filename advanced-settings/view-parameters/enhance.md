Viewer-Side Option! ([`&view`](view.md), [`&scene`](scene.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md))

## Details

Tells the remote source that you would like them to prioritize the audio stream over other streams.

* May not be compatible with all remote sources; depends on the browser they have
* Prioritizing audio may cause problems elsewhere, such as for other viewers or for video streams
* Prioritization applies to both encoding and networking sending of audio packets
* May override custom ptime values
* This option may be useful in reducing audio 'clicking', but likely will be just as effective as a placebo

For advanced users, this sets the following of the audio's stream: `networkPriority = "high";` `priority = "high";` `adaptivePtime = true;`
