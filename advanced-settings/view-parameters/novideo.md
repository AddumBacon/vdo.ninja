## Details

`&novideo` disables all video playback on the local computer, except for any stream ID that is listed. Useful for reducing the CPU and network load on other connect peers if voice-chat is sufficient.

* Join a group-room as audio-only, to limit load on the guests.
* Useful for a large group room where you want everyone in the room to see only the OBS Virtualcam output.
* Consider using `&broadcast` option instead of this flag as it is better suited for presenting a single feed to a group than using `&novideo` alone.

When used together with [`&noaudio`](noaudio.md) (`&novideo&noaudio`), prevents guest room member from seeing or hearing other member's audio or video feeds.

* Useful for directors who may wish to only issue commands or text chat, but not need to see video or audio.
