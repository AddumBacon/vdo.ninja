description: Custom video codec for broadcasts

# \&webp

Viewer-Side Option! ([`&view`](view.md), [`&scene`](scene.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md))

## Details

Must be used with [`&broadcast`](broadcast.md), but the director doesn't need to be the designated broadcaster.

The Electron Capture app should work to allow for webp-based broadcasting even if the tab is not visible, as tab throttling is disabled with that application.\
This is essentially a stream of webp-based images sent over the webRTC data-channels.\
The quality by default is limited in both frame rate and resolution, as this custom video codec is very inefficient at higher resolutions and frame-rates.

Based on my testing, the webp mode is only efficient if you are keeping the bitrates under like 2 mbps, so the higher qualities make little sense IMO outside of some niche use cases as they use up a lot of bandwidth.

If you have issues with Webp-mode, or find the quality or CPU savings not sufficient, you can check out the [Meshcast.io](https://meshcast.io/) integration instead. It's a relatively new supported addition to VDO.Ninja
