# Blue spinning window

_**If you are experiencing this issue and you are using MacOS, please refer to the MacOS specific section**_

If this happens, there could be numerous reasons.

* Check that you have hardware-acceleration turned on, within OBS, and have updated your graphic drivers.
* Ensure that you are not behind a VPN or firewall. Symmetrical firewalls may block OBS.Ninja traffic.
* If on macOS, use the Electron Capture application instead of the Browser source used by OBS (Also ensure you are running OBS v26.1.2 or newer!).
* Try using a VPN, such as Speedify, to bypass any networking firewalls that your ISP may have enabled.
* Check [test.webrtc.org](https://test.webrtc.org/).

#### Are you using cellular?

* If you are on cellular, try connecting to Wi-Fi instead.
* Ensure your are using a compatible browser (Safari on iOS or Chrome on Android).
* Older iOS devices do not work.
* Check [test.webrtc.org](https://test.webrtc.org/).

#### Are you on IPv6?

Check to make sure your TURN server supports IPv6. The ones I provide _should_ support it though. Check [test.webrtc.org](https://test.webrtc.org/).

#### Are you using an iPhone?

There are numerous issues with iOS devices; see the [iOS help section](https://github.com/steveseguin/obsninja/wiki/FAQ#ios) for more info. Check [test.webrtc.org](https://test.webrtc.org/).

#### Are you within a condo building or corporate office?

Firewalls may be setup that block traffic of this type. Talk to your network administrator Other problems? Check [test.webrtc.org](https://test.webrtc.org/) and see if anything is marked as "RED". You can also try different networks and see if that helps.

In the meantime, [OBS.Ninja/old](https://obs.ninja/old) is up, and will remain up until I can resolve all the issues with the new release. This may solve your issue temporarily. So if you have this problem , where you see the fullscreen video, but it is just grey and spinning, then it could be a network issue.
