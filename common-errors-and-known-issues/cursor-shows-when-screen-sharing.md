# Cursor shows when screen-sharing

Most browsers do not allow the mouse cursor to be hidden when screen sharing.&#x20;

For gaming, this can be am obvious problem.

You can setup the OBS Virtual Camera to output a specific scene or screen-share, rather than the current active scene, using this filter:\

If you prefer not to use OBS at all, there are numerous screen-sharing tools that can turn your screen into a virtual camera. Below is a link to a free one for Windows:

Eventually cursor-visibility control will be available for Chrome, but for now, it will be a bit more hassle.
