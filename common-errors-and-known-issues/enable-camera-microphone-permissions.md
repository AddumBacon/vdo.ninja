# Enable Camera / Microphone permissions

Once camera / microphone permission have been denied, often accidentally, the browser won't let VDO.Ninja ask for it again. You'll need to manually change the permission to fix it, or use a different browser. How to change the permission depends on the browser and operation system.

I've provided links to some guides. If these guides are helpful for you, I'll offer a guide in [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/) to help future users when I detect permissions have been denied.
