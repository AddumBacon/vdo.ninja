## Where can I get support?

The preferred support mechanism is via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VDONinja/) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/feenJm8HTa), which offer community-assisted support. Development issues, feature requests, and bugs are tracked on [Github](https://github.com/steveseguin/obsninja). For mission critical support issues, or business-related inquiries, you can contact Steve directly.

## Where can I report a bug?

It is most helpful to report bugs via the official [Github](https://github.com/steveseguin/obsninja). We also monitor the [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VDONinja/) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/qWDshMsTar) channels, though it is easier to miss reports that occur there.
