description: Forces TURN relay server into use
---

# \&relay

General Option! ([`&push`](../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](room.md), [`&view`](../advanced-settings/view-parameters/view.md), [`&scene`](../advanced-settings/view-parameters/scene.md))

## Aliases

* `&private`
* `&privacy`

## Details

Forcing relay mode is provided for testing and emergency purposes. It will increase latency; sometimes by a lot.

Alternatives to relay mode include:

* Using wired Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi will also reduce packet loss.
* A VPN service, like Speedify, will likely be better than using a TURN server.

Uses of relay mode include:

* Can potentially reduce packet loss with some guests on bad connections.
* Has the advantage of hiding your IP address from peers.

You can [deploy your own TURN server](https://github.com/steveseguin/obsninja/blob/master/turnserver.md) if intending to use this feature a lot.

Please feel free to donate to OBS.Ninja to help support the provided TURN servers.\
Current TURN servers are deployed in North America and Germany.\
TCP/UDP on port 443.
