# \&stats

General Option! ([`&push`](../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](room.md), [`&view`](../advanced-settings/view-parameters/view.md), [`&scene`](../advanced-settings/view-parameters/scene.md))

## Details

Adding `&stats` to a URL shows the connection/media stats window.

On desktop, you can hold `CTRL` (or `CMD`) and `Left-Click` a video to get its stats.\
On Version 22 you can `Right-Click` -> Stats on a video feed to get its stats.

On mobile, you can just rapidly touch the display to trigger the stats window instead.

The `&stats` URL parameter is for those like vMix users who might not be able to interact with the browser source.
