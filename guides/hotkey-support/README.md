description: Some keyboard hotkeys
---

# Basic hotkeys

`CTRL + M` => Mute your mic (audio output)

`CTRL + B` => Mute your video output

`SHIFT + ALT + C` => Toggle the control bar that's normally at the bottom of the screen.

`CTRL + ALT + F` => Open the file-sharing window

`CTRL + ALT + C` => Cycle the camera to the next camera available

`CTRL + ALT + S` => Open the screen-sharing window

\[On macOS use `CMD` instead of `CTRL`]

When using the above keyboard short-cuts, the tab/window must be actively in focus.

When using the Electron Capture app in elevated privilege mode, the keyboard shortcuts are global.
