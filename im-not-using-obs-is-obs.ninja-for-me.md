# I'm not using OBS; is VDO.Ninja for me?

The technologies used in the creation of [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja) are application agnostic; you can use it with a broad variety of applications other than OBS Studio.

To that end, **any software that contains a modern browser-based source capture option or that has window-capture capabilities should be compatible with VDO.Ninja.** This includes OBS Studio, **VMix**, Vingester.app, **ManyCam**, Unity, Electron.js, CEF, and more.

Please note, VDO.Ninja is tested to be compatible with OBS Studio ([obsproject.com](http://obsproject.com/)), and there are some added OBS-specific optimizations included with VDO.Ninja. Tally lights may not work for example with other software.
