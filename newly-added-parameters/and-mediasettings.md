Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](../source-settings/push.md))

## Details

Adds the option for a guest to change the video "quality" (resolution) dynamically:

* Max Resolution (1920x1080p)
* Balanced (1280x720p)
* Smooth and Cool (720x360p)

Outside of a room it is enabled by default. You can preset the resolution with [`&quality`](../advanced-settings/video-parameters/and-quality.md).
