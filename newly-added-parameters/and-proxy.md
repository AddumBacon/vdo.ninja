# \&proxy

General Option! ([`&push`](../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](../general-settings/room.md), [`&view`](../advanced-settings/view-parameters/view.md), [`&scene`](../advanced-settings/view-parameters/scene.md))

## Details

You can add `&proxy` to the view/push/director/scene link or wherever. This simply forces your computer to try to connect to the handshake service via a different physical network end point and domain name, which might help if the Internet ever splits in two. The purposes of this flag is that sometimes ISPs/network routers mess up, and this is just a backup option to get around those errors. This is just a backup option to get around it. While this should try to connect to the closest edge node relative to your location.

I don't recommend using this feature unless there are problems.
