# \&screensharehide

Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](../source-settings/push.md))

## Aliases

* `&sshide`
* `&hidescreenshare`
* `&hidess`

## Details

Just hides the local screen-share sub-window that appears when screen sharing in a room. You can use this if you want to screenshare in a room, but you don't want to see your own screenshare.

Using [`&screensharetype=3`](and-screensharetype.md) also hides the local screen-share window.
