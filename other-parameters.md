| `&aspectratio`      | Changes the aspect ratio on the publisher side.

| `&crop`             | <p>Changes the aspect ratio on the publisher side, but lets you pass an integer value to represent a percentile cropping value.<br><br>So, <code>&#x26;crop=10</code> will reduce the aspect ratio by 10% and <code>&#x26;crop=-10</code> will increase the aspect ratio.
