# v16.3

This is just a minor version update; pushing it out so I can start getting v17 into beta.

* `&rooms=room1,room2` has been added for easier multi room transfer (via duncan).
* `&website` embedding has been greatly improved; twitch/youtube support streamlined.
* Guests will get a message when transferred.
* `&scenes` can be used by the director to allow for more scene buttons (`&scene=3` for example can be used now) (`&scene=2` is funky, so keep that in mind if using it).
* `&channels` is added to the director's options; it lets you output audio of a guest to a different audio channel.
* Improve mobile support; rotating the phone doesn't break the sizing of videos (bug in v16 fixed).
* `&videodevice` and `&audiodevice` now support device names and still device sink IDs.
* Changed the fullscreen icons.
* Languages updated (dutch).
* Numerous other polish items added, including some fixes contributed via github by users.

Thank you to everyone for the feedback and suggestions. -steve
