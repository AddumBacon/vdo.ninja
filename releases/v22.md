### Thank you

\
â€‹I'd like to thank JK14, leb, SilverServerT, and the many others for helping out with the community on Discord with user support during development of version 22. JK14 also made significant contributions towards organizing and updating the documentation, while leb rewrote our beloved Discord Ninja bot to be better than ever, so many thanks there. We also had a Sam MacKinnon revamp the Iframe sandbox page, which looks and works great.\

I'd also like to thank everyone else who made a contribution to the project, not least the sponsors and donors; your generosity is sincerely valued.&#x20;
