description: Enables a "Raise Hand" button for guests
---

# \&hands

Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](push.md))

## Aliases

* `&hand`

## Details

If pressed, and the user is in a room, the room's director will get a notification that the user pressed the button.

It will do nothing if the room does not have a director in it.

The director can dismiss the user's action.

There is a toggle in the director's room which adds `&hand` to the guest's invite link.![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (107).png>)
