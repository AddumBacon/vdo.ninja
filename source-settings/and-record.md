## Details

### Recorded file properties

**`File format`**` ``- WebM.` &#x20;

**`File Codec:`**` ``H264 or VP8 for video; OPUS or PCM for audio.` &#x20;

Usually up to the browser.&#x20;

Default bitrate will record at around 6000 kbps, but it will still prompt still for value if not set.

The Director of a room will be notified if a user is recording and they can start/stop the recording.\
The Director of a room can trigger the record function remotely, even if the \&record parameter has not been added.

The video/audio will be saved in real-time to the guest's local download folder.

Do not close the browser or turn off the computer while it is recording; you may lose the file or have a partial capture.

The recording should stop automatically when the guest hangs-ups manually.

It will automatically capture with Stereo audio and echo cancellation off, if available. You can use [https://obs.ninja/convert](https://obs.ninja/convert) to convert from WebM file formats to opus or wav file formats, **without transcoding and without downloads**.

### Bitrate Thresholds

| Threshold      | Inbound Audio | Recorded audio |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| 4000           | 128 kpbs      | 128 kpbs       |
| 2500           | 80 kbps       | 128 kpbs       |
| Less than 2500 | 32 kbps       | 32 kbps        |

{% hint style="info" %}
When recording with PCM, ([`&pcm`](and-pcm.md)) the inbound audio bitrate will be at 256kbps. (regardless of video bitrate)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Safari browsers and iOS devices may struggle with media recording.\
\
Enabling Safari's _MediaRecorder_ under E_xperimental webKit Features_ may be needed. As well, users may be asked to download a file once the recording ends, for the webM media file to be saved correctly to disk.
