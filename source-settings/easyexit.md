# \&easyexit

Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](push.md))

## Aliases

* `&ee`

## Details

To prevent accidental page refreshes or exits during a stream, VDO.Ninja will ask the user to confirm they wish to leave the page when they try to. Using `&easyexit` prevents this confirmation pop-up from occurring, which might be useful if you are doing a lot of testing and find the added clicking to be annoying.

It hides this popup:\
