# \&nofileshare

Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](push.md),[`&room`](../general-settings/room.md))

## Aliases

* `&nodownloads`
* `&nofiles`

## Details

In some cases, the guest will have a button by default to upload files to the group room.

Using `&nofileshare`**,** the button needed to select and share a file will be hidden.

This may also prevent a guest from being able to download files that are shared with them.
