# \&ptz

Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](push.md))

## Details

Enables pan/tilt/zoom control of the device, if compatible.

This will trigger a new permission popup though.

Can be added to a guest's URL in a room. Then the director can manually change pan, tilt and zoom for the guest's camera.

Can also be added to a simple push link, then you can change pan, tilt and zoom in the video settings.\
