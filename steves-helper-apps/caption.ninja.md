# Caption.Ninja

## Caption

{% embed url="https://caption.ninja/" %}

Although VDO.Ninja supports captions, sometimes you need something simple yet flexible. Caption.Ninja lets you use the browser's built in speech-to-text service to provide overlay captions for your live stream.\
\
Captions are streamed via a web-socket service to your OBS or other studio software, where they can be shown over your video.

Transcriptions can be saved by means of copy and paste when done, multiple languages are supported, and even **manual** user-entered captions support is provided at [https://caption.ninja/manual](https://caption.ninja/manual)

## Translation

[https://caption.ninja/translate](https://caption.ninja/translate)

Added a "translation" component to caption.ninja, so you can convert speakers to a single language for overlay on stream. I tried this before, but only now do I think I have it working okay. There's two ways to use it:

1\. You can go here to explore and tinker.[ https://caption.ninja/translate](https://caption.ninja/translate) which offers a bit of a menu to play with, but is sender's side-based translation (works in a single page, but you can't translate to more than one language)

2\. And then there's the normal way of using caption.ninja, which offers viewer-side translation and scrolling support, so you can use this mode to have different languages as outputs instead of just one (assuming the viewer supports the translation code).

[https://caption.ninja/?room=ufv3QaH\&lang=en-US](https://caption.ninja/?room=ufv3QaH\&lang=en-US) (to capture as english) and [https://caption.ninja/overlay?room=ufv3QaH\&translate=fr](https://caption.ninja/overlay?room=ufv3QaH\&translate=fr) (viewer-side, which converts to french).

I welcome feedback.
