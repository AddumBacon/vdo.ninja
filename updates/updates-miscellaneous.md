# Updates - Miscellaneous

#### September 9

* Fixed an issue with with passwords containing special characters being used at invite.vdo.ninja

#### August 6

* The Discord bot on our [VDO.Ninja server](https://discord.gg/Hk9aKgtUHc) is a custom-made one, with the goal being to have a single bot running everything here. [@leb](https://github.com/lebaston100) made a large update to the bot this week, which includes Reddit support, added support for !commands within our new Threading system. (the old third-party reddit bot broke, so it's just an extra reason to remove it and do it ourselves)\
  There's other improvements, such as smarter spam detection, images/avatars added to the new [updates.vdo.ninja](https://updates.vdo.ninja/) feature, responses are now embedded replies, and dynamic command updates are supported.\
  The code is open source here: [https://github.com/steveseguin/discordbot](https://github.com/steveseguin/discordbot)\
  Thanks [@leb](https://github.com/lebaston100)

#### July 27

* Improved the messaging at [vdo.ninja/convert](https://isolated.vdo.ninja/convert); warns if file is too large and offers ffmpeg/handbreak alternatives in those cases. (also more input file formats supported)
