# \&showdirector

Director Option / Viewer-Side Option! ([`&director`](director.md), [`&scene`](../advanced-settings/view-parameters/scene.md))

## Aliases

* `&sd`

## Details

This URL value can be added to the director's URL (`&director=XXXX&showdirector`) or to the scene link (`&scene&showdirector`) when you wish the director to appear in those links. You can also enable this flag a couple other ways.

* As a director, you will now appear as a performer kind of like other performers.
* The ability to add/remove the director's camera/audio from scenes becomes available, including a new highlight guest option, the ability to record, re-order, and more.
* By default, a director normally won't appear in any scene link or group link, and has limited functions available.

* When a director enables their camera, while in `&showdirector` mode, they gain access to following set of options for the director's camera feed specifically:
