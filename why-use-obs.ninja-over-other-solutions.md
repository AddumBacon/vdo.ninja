# Why use VDO.Ninja over other solutions?

In some cases, the functionality of [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja) may overlap with existing solutions. However, in its primary function as an ultra-low latency peer-to-peer video bridge to OBS, it has many benefits and advantages over other methods:

* **100% free.** There's **no downloads** required, **no personal data collected**, and **no sign-in** needed.
* Compatible with most modern browsers and mobile devices.
* **Free support** offered via email, discord, reddit, and numerous written guides.
* Video data is peer-to-peer, so unlike Skype, your video data does not go thru the NSA's spying servers
* **Video can be transferred over a LAN directly**, so if using your phone as a webcam, you can crank the bitrates up to 40mbps if you want, and your Internet upload bandwidth won't be affected at all.
* Video does not go thru a server, so there is less latency as there is less distance to travel. I'm talking as low as 30ms, and normally it never goes higher than 200ms.
* There are no downloads required for sharing video -- just send the web link to a guest and they can access the service on nearly any device.
* The interface is open-source, so you can white-label, stylize, tweak, and deploy the website code however you want.
* Playback of video has been tested to even work on LG's CX OLED displays using Amazon Silk browser
* No plugin additional plugins are needed for OBS -- just drag the selected link into OBS (v25 or newer on PC\*) and it auto generates the OBS Browser source with the correct resolution. (\*[MacOS](https://github.com/steveseguin/obsninja/wiki/FAQ#MacOS) users need to update to OBS v26.1.2 to access support for VDO.Ninja natively.)
* **QR Code support for invite links**, which allows for easy ingestion of mobile devices without needing to use the keyboard.
* **Reusable invite links**, so **OBS Browser sources don't need to be re-created** or changed once created and shared.
* Adjustable resolutions and bitrates (1920x1080p60 @ 30-mbps -- or even custom resolutions). I've hit 4K @ 30fps in some testing, although it does require a fast computer in that case.
* There is a browser-based video control room for managing feeds and control videos within scenes of OBS.
* There are no overlays and no windows to crop -- VDO.Ninja auto-fills the window an if there is a black border, it becomes a transparent layer.
* **Control over audio denoise**, **echo-cancellation**, and **auto-gain** is available, along with custom audio bitrates, and **stereo-sound**. It is an exceptional tool for podcasters and live streaming DJs.
* In group chat (rooms) there is an "auto-mix" mode, making for easy management of dynamic group chat sessions.
* Free TURN servers are hosted for VDO.Ninja users, which normally are quite costly, but are kindly subsidized by community sponsors and by Steve, the developer of the application. [Sponsor ‚ù§](getting-started/sponsor.md)&#x20;
* Group rooms and streams can be **password protected** and given extra security.
* **Tally-light** support is offered when VDO.Ninja is used in conjunction with OBS.
* The group-room director has a **"push to talk"** capability, along with text-chat being available.
* Support for **ISO feed recording** via the director's control room.
* Those in a **group-chat can also be split up into individual streams**, so the OBS director has control to treat them like different sources in OBS ,switching and mixing as they want.
* With little dependence on video servers, at peak usage hours video quality does not suffer.
* VDO.Ninja is a **project of passion**, **built by creators for creators**, and we like to think it shows.
